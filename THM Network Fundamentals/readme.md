# What is Networking?
https://tryhackme.com/room/whatisnetworking

### Task 1  What is Networking?
Networks are simply things connected. For example, your friendship circle: you are all connected because of similar interests, hobbies, skills and sorts.

Networks can be found in all walks of life:

A city's public transportation system
Infrastructure such as the national power grid for electricity
Meeting and greeting your neighbours
Postal systems for sending letters and parcels
But more specifically, in computing, networking is the same idea, just dispersed to technological devices. Take your phone as an example; the reason that you have it is to access things. We'll cover how these devices communicate with each other and the rules that follow.

In computing, a network can be formed by anywhere from 2 devices to billions. These devices include everything from your laptop and phone to security cameras, traffic lights and even farming!

Networks are integrated into our everyday life. Be it gathering data for the weather, delivering electricity to homes or even determining who has the right of way at a road. Because networks are so embedded in the modern-day, networking is an essential concept to grasp in cybersecurity.

Take the diagram below as an example, Alice, Bob and Jim have formed their network! We'll come onto this a bit later on.

Networks come in all shapes and sizes, which is something that we will also come on to discuss throughout this module. 
- What is the key term for devices that are connected together?
```
Network
```

### Task 2  What is the Internet?
Now that we've learnt what a network is and how one is defined in computing (just devices connected), let's explore the Internet.

The Internet is one giant network that consists of many, many small networks within itself. Using our example from the previous task, let's now imagine that Alice made some new friends named Zayn and Toby that she wants to introduce to Bob and Jim. The problem is that Alice is the only person who speaks the same language as Zayn and Toby. So Alice will have to be the messenger!

Because Alice can speak both languages, they can communicate to one another through Alice â€” forming a new network.

The first iteration of the Internet was within the ARPANET project in the late 1960s. This project was funded by the United States Defence Department and was the first documented network in action. However, it wasn't until 1989 when the Internet as we know it was invented by Tim Berners-Lee by the creation of the World Wide Web (WWW). It wasn't until this point that the Internet wasn't used as a repository for storing and sharing information (like it is today).

Let's relate Alice's network of friends to computing devices. The Internet looks like a much larger version of this sort of diagram:

As previously stated, the Internet is made up of many small networks all joined together.  These small networks are called private networks, where networks connecting these small networks are called public networks -- or the Internet! So, to recap, a network can be one of two types:

A private network
A public network
Devices will use a set of labels to identify themselves on a network, which we will come onto in the task below.

- Who invented the World Wide Web?
```
Tim Berners-Lee
```


### Task 3  Identifying Devices on a Network
To communicate and maintain order, devices must be both identifying and identifiable on a network. What use is it if you don't know whom you're talking to at the end of the day?

Devices on a network are very similar to humans in the fact that we have two ways of being identified:

Our Name
Our Fingerprints
Now we can change our name through deed poll, but we can't, however, change our fingerprints. Every human has an individual set of fingerprints which means that even if they change their name, there is still an identity behind it. Devices have the same thing: two means of identification, with one being permeable. These are:

An IP Address
A Media Access Control (MAC) Address -- think of this as being similar to a serial number.

IP Addresses
Briefly, an IP address (or Internet Protocol) address can be used as a way of identifying a host on a network for a period of time, where that IP address can then be associated with another device without the IP address changing. First, let's split up precisely what an IP address is in the diagram below:

An IP address is a set of numbers that are divided into four octets. The value of each octet will summarise to be the IP address of the device on the network. This number is calculated through a technique known as IP addressing & subnetting, but that is for another day. What's important to understand here is that IP addresses can change from device to device but cannot be active simultaneously more than once within the same network.

IP Addresses follow a set of standards known as protocols. These protocols are the backbone of networking and force many devices to communicate in the same language, which is something that we'll come onto another time. However, we should recall that devices can be on both a private and public network. Depending on where they are will determine what type of IP address they have: a public or private IP address.

A public address is used to identify the device on the Internet, whereas a private address is used to identify a device amongst other devices. Take the table & screenshot below as an example. Here we have two devices on a private network:

These two devices will be able to use their private IP addresses to communicate with each other. However, any data sent to the Internet from either of these devices will be identified by the same public IP address. Public IP addresses are given by your Internet Service Provider (or ISP) at a monthly fee (your bill!)

As more and more devices become connected, it is becoming increasingly harder to get a public address that isn't already in use. For example, Cisco, an industry giant in the world of networking, estimated that there would be approximately 50 billion devices connected on the Internet by the end of 2021. (Cisco., 2021). Enter IP address versions. So far, we have only discussed one version of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme known as IPv4, which uses a numbering system of 2^32 IP addresses (4.29 billion) -- so you can see why there is such a shortage!

IPv6 is a new iteration of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme to help tackle this issue. Although it is seemingly more daunting, it boasts a few benefits:

Supports up to 2^128 of IP addresses (340 trillion-plus), resolving the issues faced with IPv4
More efficient due to new methodologies
The screenshot below compares both an IPv6 and IPv4 address.

MAC Addresses

Devices on a network will all have a physical network interface, which is a microchip board found on the device's motherboard. This network interface is assigned a unique address at the factory it was built at, called a MAC (Media Access Control ) address. The MAC address is a twelve-character hexadecimal number (a base sixteen numbering system used in computing to represent numbers) split into two's and separated by a colon. These colons are considered separators. For example, a4:c3:f0:85:ac:2d. The first six characters represent the company that made the network interface, and the last six is a unique number.

However, an interesting thing with MAC addresses is that they can be faked or "spoofed" in a process known as spoofing. This spoofing occurs when a networked device pretends to identify as another using its MAC address. When this occurs, it can often break poorly implemented security designs that assume that devices talking on a network are trustworthy. Take the following scenario: A firewall is configured to allow any communication going to and from the MAC address of the administrator. If a device were to pretend or "spoof" this MAC address, the firewall would now think that it is receiving communication from the administrator when it isn't.

Places such as cafes, coffee shops, and hotels alike often use MAC address control when using their "Guest "or "Public" Wi-Fi. This configuration could offer better services, i.e. a faster connection for a price if you are willing to pay the fee per device.  The interactive lab attached to this task has been made to replicate this scenario!

Practical

The interactive labs simulate a hotel Wi-Fi network where you have to pay for the service. You'll note that the router is not allowing Bob's packets ( blue) to the TryHackMe website and is placing them in the bin, but Alice's packets (green) are going through fine because she has paid for Wi-Fi. Try changing Bob's MAC address to the same as Alice's to see what happens.

Deploy the interactive lab and proceed to answer the following questions below.

### Task 4  Ping (ICMP)
Ping is one of the most fundamental network tools available to us. Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to determine the performance of a connection between devices, for example, if the connection exists or is reliable.

The time taken for ICMP packets travelling between devices is measured by ping, such as in the screenshot below. This measuring is done using ICMP's echo packet and then ICMP's echo reply from the target device.

Pings can be performed against devices on a network, such as your home network or resources like websites. This tool can be easily used and comes installed on Operating Systems (OSs) such as Linux and Windows. The syntax to do a simple ping is ping IP address or website URL. Let's see this in action in the screenshot below.

Here we are pinging a device that has the private address of 192.168.1.254. Ping informs us that we have sent six ICMP packets, all of which were received with an average time of 5.3 seconds.



Now you are going to do the same thing to ping the address of "8.8.8.8" on the deployable website in this task. Pinging the correct address will reveal a flag to answer the following question below.

- What protocol does ping use?
```
ICMP
```
- What is the syntax to ping 10.10.10.10?
```
ping 10.10.10.10
```
- What flag do you get when you ping 8.8.8.8?

# Intro to LAN
### Task 1  Introducing LAN Topologies
Local Area Network (LAN) Topologies

Over the years, there has been experimentation and implementation of various network designs.  In reference to networking, when we refer to the term "topology", we are actually referring to the design or look of the network at hand. Let's discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these topologies below.



#### [Star Topology](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-lan/star.png)

The main premise of a star topology is that devices are individually connected via a central networking device such as a switch or hub. This topology is the most commonly found today because of its reliability and scalability - despite the cost.

Any information sent to a device in this topology is sent via the central device to which it connects. Let's explore some of these advantages and disadvantages of this topology below:

Because more cabling & the purchase of dedicated networking equipment is required for this topology, it is more expensive than any of the other topologies. However, despite the added cost, this does provide some significant advantages. For example, this topology is much more scalable in nature, which means that it is very easy to add more devices as the demand for the network increases.

Unfortunately, the more the network scales, the more maintenance is required to keep the network functional. This increased dependence on maintenance can also make troubleshooting faults much harder. Furthermore, the star topology is still prone to failure - albeit reduced. For example, if the centralised hardware that connects devices fails, these devices will no longer be able to send or receive data. Thankfully, these centralised hardware devices are often robust.

#### [Bus Topology](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-lan/bus.png) 

This type of connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable. This type of topology is similar to the leaf off of a tree in the sense that devices (leaves) stem from where the branches are on this cable.
Because all data destined for each device travels along the same cable, it is very quickly prone to becoming slow and bottlenecked if devices within the topology are simultaneously requesting data. This bottleneck also results in very difficult troubleshooting because it quickly becomes difficult to identify which device is experiencing issues with data all travelling along the same route.

However, with this said, bus topologies are one of the easier and more cost-efficient topologies to set up because of their expenses, such as cabling or dedicated networking equipment used to connect these devices.

Lastly, another disadvantage of the bus topology is that there is little redundancy in place in case of failures. This disadvantage is because there is a single point of failure along the backbone cable. If this cable were to break, devices can no longer receive or transmit data along the bus.

#### [Ring Topology](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-lan/ring.png)

The ring topology (also known as token topology) boasts some similarities. Devices such as computers are connected directly to each other to form a loop, meaning that there is little cabling required and less dependence on dedicated hardware such as within a star topology. 

A ring topology works by sending data across the loop until it reaches the destined device, using other devices along the loop to forward the data. Interestingly, a device will only send received data from another device in this topology if it does not have any to send itself. If the device happens to have data to send, it will send its own data first before sending data from another device.

Because there is only one direction for data to travel across this topology, it is fairly easy to troubleshoot any faults that arise. However, this is a double-edged sword because it isn't an efficient way of data travelling across a network, as it may have to visit many multiple devices first before reaching the intended device.

Lastly, ring topologies are less prone to bottlenecks, such as within a bus topology, as large amounts of traffic are not travelling across the network at any one time. The design of this topology does, however, mean that a fault such as cut cable, or broken device will result in the entire networking breaking. 

#### [What is a Switch?](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-lan/switches.png)

Switches are dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, or any other networking-capable device using ethernet. These various devices plug into a switch's port. Switches are usually found in larger networks such as businesses, schools, or similar-sized networks, where there are many devices to connect to the network. Switches can connect a large number of devices by having ports of 4, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 64 for devices to plug into.

Switches are much more efficient than their lesser counterpart (hubs/repeaters). Switches keep track of what device is connected to which port. This way, when they receive a packet, instead of repeating that packet to every port like a hub would do, it just sends it to the intended target, thus reducing network traffic.

Both Switches and Routers can be connected to one another. The ability to do this increases the redundancy (the reliability) of a network by adding multiple paths for data to take. If one path goes down, another can be used. Whilst this may reduce the overall performance of a network because packets have to take longer to travel, there is no downtime -- a small price to pay considering the alternative.

#### [What is a Router?](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-networking/what-is-the-internet/routing2.png)
It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them. It does this by using routing (hence the name router!).

Routing is the label given to the process of data travelling across networks. Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered.

Routing is useful when devices are connected by many paths, such as in the example diagram below.

### Task 2  A Primer on Subnetting
As we've previously discussed throughout the module so far, Networks can be found in all shapes and sizes - ranging from small to large. Subnetting is the term given to splitting up a network into smaller, miniature networks within itself. Think of it as slicing up a cake for your friends. There's only a certain amount of cake to go around, but everybody wants a piece. Subnetting is you deciding who gets what slice & reserving such a slice of this metaphorical cake.

Take a business, for example; You will have different departments such as:

Accounting
Finance
Human Resources

#### [Subnet22](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-lan/subnet22.png)

Whilst you know where to send information in real life to the correct department, networks need to know as well. Network administrators use subnetting to categorise and assign specific parts of a network to reflect this.

Subnetting is achieved by splitting up the number of hosts that can fit within the network, represented by a number called a subnet mask. Let's refer back to our diagram from the first room in this module:
#### [Subnet1](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-lan/subnet1.png)

As we can recall, an IP address is made up of four sections called octets. The same goes for a subnet mask which is also represented as a number of four bytes (32 bits), ranging from 0 to 255 (0-255).

Subnets use IP addresses in three different ways:

Identify the network address
Identify the host address
Identify the default gateway

Now, in small networks such as at home, you will be on one subnet as there is an unlikely chance that you need more than 254 devices connected at one time.

However, places such as businesses and offices will have much more of these devices (PCs, printers, cameras and sensors), where subnetting takes place.

Subnetting provides a range of benefits, including:

Efficiency
Security
Full control
We'll come on to explore exactly how subnetting provides these benefits at a later date; however, for now, all we need to understand is the security element to it. Let's take the typical cafÃ© on the street. This cafe will have two networks:

One for employees, cash registers, and other devices for the facility
One for the general public to use as a hotspot
Subnetting allows you to separate these two use cases from each other whilst having the benefits of a connection to larger networks such as the Internet.

```

```

```
Network Address
```
- What address is used to identify devices within a network?
```
Host Address
```
- What is the name used to identify the device responsible for sending data to another network?
```
Default Gateway
```

### Task 3  The ARP Protocol
Recalling from our previous tasks that devices can have two identifiers: A MAC address and an IP address, the ARP protocol or Address Resolution Protocol for short, is the technology that is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network.

Simply, the ARP protocol allows a device to associate its MAC address with an IP address on the network. Each device on a network will keep a log of the MAC addresses associated with other devices.

When devices wish to communicate with another, they will send a broadcast to the entire network searching for the specific device. Devices can use the ARP protocol to find the MAC address (and therefore the physical identifier) of a device for communication.

How does ARP Work?

Each device within a network has a ledger to store information on, which is called a cache. In the context of the ARP protocol, this cache stores the identifiers of other devices on the network.

In order to map these two identifiers together (IP address and MAC address), the ARP protocol sends two types of messages:

ARP Request
ARP Reply
When an ARP request is sent, a message is broadcasted to every other device found on a network by the device, asking whether or not the device's MAC address matches the requested IP address. If the device does have the requested IP address, an ARP reply is returned to the initial device to acknowledge this. The initial device will now remember this and store it within its cache (an ARP entry). 

- What does ARP stand for?
```
Address Resolution Protocol
```
- What category of ARP Packet asks a device whether or not it has a specific IP address?
```
Request
```
- What address is used as a physical identifier for a device on a network?
```
MAC Address
```
- What address is used as a logical identifier for a device on a network?
```
IP Address
```

### Task 4  The DHCP Protocol
IP addresses can be assigned either manually, by entering them physically into a device, or automatically and most commonly by using a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. When a device connects to a network, if it has not already been manually assigned an IP address, it sends out a request (DHCP Discover) to see if any DHCP servers are on the network. The DHCP server then replies back with an IP address the device could use (DHCP Offer). The device then sends a reply confirming it wants the offered IP Address (DHCP Request), and then lastly, the DHCP server sends a reply acknowledging this has been completed, and the device can start using the IP Address (DHCP ACK).

- What type of DHCP packet is used by a device to retrieve an IP address?
```
DHCP Discover
```
- What type of DHCP packet does a device send once it has been offered an IP address by the DHCP server?
```
DHCP Request
```
- Finally, what is the last DHCP packet that is sent to a device from a DHCP server?
```
DHCP ACK
```
### Task 5  Continue Your Learning: OSI Model
Continue your learning by joining the "OSI Model" room.

# OSI Model
### Task 1  What is the OSI Model?
The OSI model (or Open Systems Interconnection Model) is an absolute fundamental model used in networking.  This critical model provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive and interpret data.

One of the main benefits of the OSI model is that devices can have different functions and designs on a network while communicating with other devices. Data sent across a network that follows the uniformity of the OSI model can be understood by other devices.

The OSI model consists of seven layers which are illustrated in the diagram below. Each layer has a different set of responsibilities and is arranged from Layer 7 to Layer 1.

At every individual layer that data travels through, specific processes take place, and pieces of information are added to this data, which is what we'll come to discuss in the upcoming tasks within this room. However, for now, we only need to understand that this process is called encapsulation and what the OSI model looks like in the diagram below:
[Image OSI Layer](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/osi-model/osimodel.svg)

- What does the "OSI" in "OSI Model" stand for?
```
Open Systems Interconnection
```
- How many layers (in digits) does the OSI model have?
```
7
```
- What is the key term for when pieces of information get added to data?
```
encapsulation
```

### Task 2  Layer 7 - Application
The application layer of the OSI model is the layer that you will be most familiar with. This familiarity is because the application layer is the layer in which protocols and rules are in place to determine how the user should interact with data sent or received.

Everyday applications such as email clients, browsers, or file server browsing software such as FileZilla provide a friendly, Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to interact with data sent or received. Other protocols include DNS (Domain Name System), which is how website addresses are translated into IP addresses.

- What is the name of this Layer?
```
Application
```
- What is the technical term that is given to the name of the software that users interact with?
```
Graphical User Interface
```

### Task 3  Layer 6 - Presentation
Layer 6 of the OSI model is the layer in which standardisation starts to take place. Because software developers can develop any software such as an email client differently, the data still needs to be handled in the same way â€” no matter how the software works.

This layer acts as a translator for data to and from the application layer (layer 7). The receiving computer will also understand data sent to a computer in one format destined for in another format. For example, when you send an email, the other user may have another email client to you, but the contents of the email will still need to display the same.

Security features such as data encryption (like HTTPS when visiting a secure site) occur at this layer.

- What is the name of this Layer?
```
Presentation
``` 
- What is the main purpose that this Layer acts as?
```
Translator
```

### Task 4  Layer 5 - Session
Once data has been correctly translated or formatted from the presentation layer (layer 6), the session layer (layer 5) will begin to create a connection to the other computer that the data is destined for. When a connection is established, a session is created. Whilst this connection is active, so is the session.

The session layer (layer 5) synchronises the two computers to ensure that they are on the same page before data is sent and received. Once these checks are in place, the session layer will begin to divide up the data sent into smaller chunks of data and begin to send these chunks (packets) one at a time. This dividing up is beneficial because if the connection is lost, only the chunks that weren't yet sent will have to be sent again â€” not the entire piece of the data (think of it as loading a save file in a video game).

What is worthy of noting is that sessions are unique â€” meaning that data cannot travel over different sessions, but in fact, only across each session instead.

- What is the name of this Layer?
```
Session
```
- What is the technical term for when a connection is successfully established?
```
Session
```
- What is the technical term for "small chunks of data"?
```
Packets
```

### Task 5  Layer 4 - Transport
Layer 4 of the OSI model plays a vital part in transmitting data across a network and can be a little bit difficult to grasp. When data is sent between devices, it follows one of two different protocols that are decided based upon several factors:

TCP
UDP
Let's begin with TCP. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). Potentially hinted by the name, this protocol is designed with reliability and guarantee in mind. This protocol reserves a constant connection between the two devices for the amount of time it takes for the data to be sent and received.

Not only this, but TCP incorporates error checking into its design. Error checking is how TCP can guarantee that data sent from the small chunks in the session layer (layer 5) has then been received and reassembled in the same order.

Let's summarise the advantages and disadvantages of TCP in the table below:

TCP is used for situations such as file sharing, internet browsing or sending an email. This usage is because these services require the data to be accurate and complete (no good having half a file!).

In the diagram below, we can see how a picture of a dog is broken down into small pieces of data (known as packets) from the "webserver", where the "computer" re-constructs the picture of the dog into the correct order.

Now let's move onto the User Datagram Protocol (or UDP for short). This protocol is not nearly as advanced as its brother - the TCP protocol. It doesn't boast the many features offered by TCP, such as error checking and reliability. In fact, any data that gets sent via UDP is sent to the computer whether it gets there or not. There is no synchronisation between the two devices or guarantee; just hope for the best, and fingers crossed.

Whilst this sounds disadvantageous, it does have its merits, which we'll layout in the table below:

Using the same example as before, we can now see that only Packets #1 and #3 have been received by the "Computer", meaning that half of the image is missing.

UDP is useful in situations where there are small pieces of data being sent. For example, protocols used for discovering devices (ARP and DHCP that we discussed in Room 2 - Intro to LAN) or larger files such as video streaming (where it is okay if some part of the video is pixelated. Pixels are just lost pieces of data!)

```

```

```

### Task 6  Layer 3 - Network
The third layer of the OSI model (network layer) is where the magic of routing & re-assembly of data takes place (from these small chunks to the larger chunk). Firstly, routing simply determines the most optimal path in which these chunks of data should be sent.

Whilst some protocols at this layer determine exactly what is the "optimal" path that data should take to reach a device, we should only know about their existence at this stage of the networking module. Briefly, these protocols include OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and RIP (Routing Information Protocol). The factors that decide what route is taken is decided by the following:

What path is the shortest? I.e. has the least amount of devices that the packet needs to travel across.
What path is the most reliable? I.e. have packets been lost on that path before?
Which path has the faster physical connection? I.e. is one path using a copper connection (slower) or a fibre (considerably faster)?
At this layer, everything is dealt with via IP addresses such as 192.168.1.100. Devices such as routers capable of delivering packets using IP addresses are known as Layer 3 devices â€” because they are capable of working at the third layer of the OSI model.

### Task 7  Layer 2 - Data Link
The data link layer focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. It receives a packet from the network layer (including the IP address for the remote computer) and adds in the physical MAC (Media Access Control) address of the receiving endpoint. Inside every network-enabled computer is a Network Interface Card (NIC) which comes with a unique MAC address to identify it.

MAC addresses are set by the manufacturer and literally burnt into the card; they can't be changed -- although they can be spoofed. When information is sent across a network, it's actually the physical address that is used to identify where exactly to send the information.

Additionally, it's also the job of the data link layer to present the data in a format suitable for transmission.

- What is the name of this Layer?
```
Data Link
```
- What is the name of the piece of hardware that all networked devices come with?
```
Network Interface Card
```

### Task 8  Layer 1 - Physical
This layer is one of the easiest layers to grasp. Put simply, this layer references the physical components of the hardware used in networking and is the lowest layer that you will find. Devices use electrical signals to transfer data between each other in a binary numbering system (1's and 0's).

For example, ethernet cables connecting devices, such as in the diagram below:
[Physical](https://cdn.cnetcontent.com/19/df/19df9af1-a653-4158-ad7c-4b0f8d581431.jpg)

# Packets & Frames
### Task 1  What are Packets and Frames
Packets and frames are small pieces of data that, when forming together, make a larger piece of information or message. However, they are two different things in the OSI model. A frame is at layer 2 - the data link layer, meaning there is no such information as IP addresses. Think of this as putting an envelope within an envelope and sending it away. The first envelope will be the packet that you mail, but once it is opened, the envelope within still exists and contains data (this is a frame).

This process is called encapsulation which we discussed in room 3: the OSI model. At this stage, it's safe to assume that when we are talking about anything IP addresses, we are talking about packets. When the encapsulating information is stripped away, we're talking about the frame itself.

Packets are an efficient way of communicating data across networked devices such as those explained in Task 1. Because this data is exchanged in small pieces, there is less chance of bottlenecking occurring across a network than large messages being sent at once.

For example, when loading an image from a website, this image is not sent to your computer as a whole, but rather small pieces where it is reconstructed on your computer. Take the image below as an illustration of this process. The dog's picture is divided into three packets, where it is reconstructed when it reaches the computer to form the final image.[Packets](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-networking/packets/packets1.png)

Packets have different structures that are dependant upon the type of packet that is being sent. As we'll come on to discuss, networking is full of standards and protocols that act as a set of rules for how the packet is handled on a device. With the Internet predicted to have approximately 50 billion devices connected by the end of 2020, things quickly get out of hand if there is no standardisation.

Let's continue with our example of the Internet Protocol. A packet using this protocol will have a set of headers that contain additional pieces of information to the data that is being sent across a network.

Some notable headers include:

- What is the name for a piece of data when it does have IP addressing information?
```
Packet
```
- What is the name for a piece of data when it does not have IP addressing information?
```
Frame
```


### Task 2  TCP/IP (The Three-Way Handshake)
TCP (or Transmission Control Protocol for short) is another one of these rules used in networking.



This protocol is very similar to the OSI model that we have previously discussed in room three of this module so far. The TCP/IP protocol consists of four layers and is arguably just a summarised version of the OSI model. These layers are:

Application
Transport
Internet
Network Interface


Very similar to how the OSI model works, information is added to each layer of the TCP model as the piece of data (or packet) traverses it. As you may recall, this process is known as encapsulation - where the reverse of this process is decapsulation.



One defining feature of TCP is that it is connection-based, which means that TCP must establish a connection between both a client and a device acting as a server before data is sent.



Because of this, TCP guarantees that any data sent will be received on the other end. This process is named the Three-way handshake, which is something we'll come on to discuss shortly. A table comparing the advantages and disadvantages of TCP is located below:

#### Table

| Advantages of TCP             | Disadvantages of TCP                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Guarantees the integrity of data. | Requires a reliable connection between the two devices. If one small chunk of data is not received, then the entire chunk of data cannot be used and must be re-sent. |
| Capable of synchronising two devices to prevent each other from being flooded with data in the wrong order. | A slow connection can bottleneck another device as the connection will be reserved on the other device the whole time. |
| Performs a lot more processes for reliability |TCP is significantly slower than UDP because more work (computing) has to be done by the devices using this protocol. |


TCP packets contain various sections of information known as headers that are added from encapsulation. Let's explain some of the crucial headers in the table below:

#### Table

|Header|Description|
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|Source Port|This value is the port opened by the sender to send the TCP packet from. This value is chosen randomly (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).|
|Destination Port|This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random.|
|Source IP|This is the IP address of the device that is sending the packet.|
|Destination IP|This is the IP address of the device that the packet is destined for.|
|Sequence Number|When a connection occurs, the first piece of data transmitted is given a random number. We'll explain this more in-depth further on.|
|Acknowledgement Number|After a piece of data has been given a sequence number, the number for the next piece of data will have the sequence number + 1. We'll also explain this more in-depth further on.|
|Checksum|This value is what gives TCP integrity. A mathematical calculation is made where the output is remembered. When the receiving device performs the mathematical calculation, the data must be corrupt if the output is different from what was sent.|
|Data|This header is where the data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored.|
|Flag|This header determines how the packet should be handled by either device during the handshake process. Specific flags will determine specific behaviours, which is what we'll come on to explain below.|

Next, we'll come on to discuss the Three-way handshake - the term given for the process used to establish a connection between two devices. The Three-way handshake communicates using a few special messages - the table below highlights the main ones:

#### Table

|Step|Message|Description|
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|1|SYN|A SYN message is the initial packet sent by a client during the handshake. This packet is used to initiate a connection and synchronise the two devices together (we'll explain this further later on).|
|2|SYN/ACK|This packet is sent by the receiving device (server) to acknowledge the synchronisation attempt from the client.|
|3|ACK|The acknowledgement packet can be used by either the client or server to acknowledge that a series of messages/packets have been successfully received.|
|4|	DATA|	Once a connection has been established, data (such as bytes of a file) is sent via the "DATA" message.|
|5|	FIN|	This packet is used to cleanly (properly) close the connection after it has been complete.|
|#|	RST|	This packet abruptly ends all communication. This is the last resort and indicates there was some problem during the process. For example, if the service or application is not working correctly, or the system has faults such as low resources. |

The diagram below shows a normal Three-way handshake process between Alice and Bob. In real life, this would be between two devices.
[TCP Handshake](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/packets-frames/tcphandshake.png)

Any sent data is given a random number sequence and is reconstructed using this number sequence and incrementing by 1. Both computers must agree on the same number sequence for data to be sent in the correct order. This order is agreed upon during three steps:

1. SYN - Client: Here's my Initial Number Sequence (ISN) to SYNchronise with (0)
2. SYN/ACK - Server: Here's my Initial Number Sequence (ISN) to SYNchronise with (5,000), and I ACKnowledge your initial number sequence (0)
3. ACK - Client: I ACKnowledge your Initial Number Sequence (ISN) of (5,000), here is some data that is my ISN+1 (5,000 + 1)

#### Table

|Device|Initial Number Sequence (ISN)	|Final Number Sequence	|
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|Client (Sender)	|0|0 + 1 = 1|
|Client (Sender)	|1|    1 + 1 = 2	|
|Client (Sender)	|2|2 + 1 = 3|

TCP Closing a Connection:
Let's quickly explain the process behind TCP closing a connection. First, TCP will close a connection once a device has determined that the other device has successfully received all of the data.

Because TCP reserves system resources on a device, it is best practice to close TCP connections as soon as possible.

To initiate the closure of a TCP connection, the device will send a "FIN" packet to the other device. Of course, with TCP, the other device will also have to acknowledge this packet.

Let's show this process using Alice and Bob as we have previously.

[TCP Handshake](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/packets-frames/tcphandshake-2.png)

In the illustration, we can see that Alice has sent Bob a "FIN" packet. Because Bob received this, he will let Alice know that he received it and that he also wants to close the connection (using FIN). Alice has heard Bob loud and clear and will let Bob know that she acknowledges this.

Enter the value of the flag given at the end of the conversation into the question below.

- What is the value of the flag given at the end of the conversation?
```
THM{TCP_CHATTER}
```

### Task 4  UDP/IP
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is another protocol that is used to communicate data between devices.



Unlike its brother TCP, UDP is a stateless protocol that doesn't require a constant connection between the two devices for data to be sent. For example, the Three-way handshake does not occur, nor is there any synchronisation between the two devices.



Recall some of the comparisons made about these two protocols in Room 3: "OSI Model". Namely, UDP is used in situations where applications can tolerate data being lost (such as video streaming or voice chat) or in scenarios where an unstable connection is not the end-all. A table comparing the advantages and disadvantages of UDP is located below:

#### Table

|Advantages of UDP|Disadvantages of UDP|
|----------------|-----------------------|
|UDP is much faster than TCP.|UDP doesn't care if the data is received or not.|
|UDP leaves the application (user software) to decide if there is any control over how quickly packets are sent.|It is quite flexible to software developers in this sense.|
|UDP does not reserve a continuous connection on a device as TCP does.|This means that unstable connections result in a terrible experience for the user.|


As mentioned, no process takes place in setting up a connection between two devices. Meaning that there is no regard for whether or not data is received, and there are no safeguards such as those offered by TCP, such as data integrity.



UDP packets are much simpler than TCP packets and have fewer headers. However, both protocols share some standard headers, which are what is annotated in the table below:

#### Table

|Header|Description|
|--------|----------|
|Time to Live (TTL)|This field sets an expiry timer for the packet, so it doesn't clog up your network if it never manages to reach a host or escape!|
|Source Address|The IP address of the device that the packet is being sent from, so that data knows where to return to.|
|Destination Address|The device's IP address the packet is being sent to so that data knows where to travel next.|
|Source Port|This value is the port that is opened by the sender to send the TCP packet from. This value is chosen randomly (out of the ports from 0-65535 that aren't already in use at the time).|
|Destination Port|This value is the port number that an application or service is running on the remote host (the one receiving data); for example, a webserver running on port 80. Unlike the source port, this value is not chosen at random.|
|Data|This header is where the data, i.e. bytes of a file that is being transmitted, is stored.|

Next, we'll come on to discuss how the process of a connection via UDP differs from that of something such as TCP.  We should recall that UDP is stateless. No acknowledgement is sent during a connection.



The diagram below shows a normal UDP connection between Alice and Bob. In real life, this would be between two devices.

### Task 5  Ports 101 (Practical)
Perhaps aptly titled by their name, ports are an essential point in which data can be exchanged. Think of a harbour and port. Ships wishing to dock at the harbour will have to go to a port compatible with the dimensions and the facilities located on the ship. When the ship lines up, it will connect to a port at the harbour. Take, for instance, that a cruise liner cannot dock at a port made for a fishing vessel and vice versa.



These ports enforce what can park and where â€” if it isn't compatible, it cannot park here. Networking devices also use ports to enforce strict rules when communicating with one another. When a connection has been established (recalling from the OSI model's room), any data sent or received by a device will be sent through these ports. In computing, ports are a numerical value between 0 and 65535 (65,535).



Because ports can range from anywhere between 0-65535, there quickly runs the risk of losing track of what application is using what port. A busy harbour is chaos! Thankfully, we associate applications, software and behaviours with a standard set of rules. For example, by enforcing that any web browser data is sent over port 80, software developers can design a web browser such as Google Chrome or Firefox to interpret the data the same way as one another.



This means that all web browsers now share one common rule: data is sent over port 80. How the browsers look, feel and easy to use is up to the designer or the user's decision.



While the standard rule for web data is port 80, a few other protocols have been allocated a standard rule. Any port that is within 0 and 1024 (1,024) is known as a common port. Let's explore some of these other protocols below:

#### Table

|Protocol|Port Number|Description|
|-------|------------|-----------|
|File Transfer Protocol (FTP)|21|This protocol is used by a file-sharing application built on a client-server model, meaning you can download files from a central location.|
|Secure Shell (SSH)|22|This protocol is used to securely login to systems via a text-based interface for management.|
|HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)|80|This protocol powers the World Wide Web (WWW)! Your browser uses this to download text, images and videos of web pages.|
|HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)|443|This protocol does the exact same as above; however, securely using encryption.|
|Server Message Block (SMB)|445|This protocol is similar to the File Transfer Protocol (FTP); however, as well as files, SMB allows you to share devices like printers.|
|Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)|3389|This protocol is a secure means of logging in to a system using a visual desktop interface (as opposed to the text-based limitations of the SSH protocol).|

We have only briefly covered the more common protocols in cybersecurity. You can find a table of the 1024 common ports listed for more information.

What is worth noting here is that these protocols only follow the standards. I.e. you can administer applications that interact with these protocols on a different port other than what is the standard (running a web server on 8080 instead of the 80 standard port). Note, however, applications will presume that the standard is being followed, so you will have to provide a colon (:) along with the port number.

#### Practical Challenge:

Open the site attached to this task and connect to the IP address "8.8.8.8" on port "1234", and you'll receive a flag.

### Task 6  Continue Your Learning: Extending Your Network
Join the final room of this networking module: "Extending Your Network", to continue your learning and complete this module.


# Extending Your Network

### Task 1  Introduction to Port Forwarding
Port forwarding is an essential component in connecting applications and services to the Internet. Without port forwarding, applications and services such as web servers are only available to devices within the same direct network.

Take the network below as an example. Within this network, the server with an IP address of "192.168.1.10" runs a webserver on port 80. Only the two other computers on this network will be able to access it (this is known as an intranet).
[Port Forwarding](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/extending-your-network/portforwarding-int.png)

If the administrator wanted the website to be accessible to the public (using the Internet), they would have to implement port forwarding, like in the diagram below:
[Port Forwarding](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/extending-your-network/portforwarding.png)

With this design, Network #2 will now be able to access the webserver running on Network #1 using the public IP address of Network #1 (82.62.51.70).

It is easy to confuse port forwarding with the behaviours of a firewall (a technology we'll come on to discuss in a later task). However, at this stage, just understand that port forwarding opens specific ports (recall how packets work). In comparison, firewalls determine if traffic can travel across these ports (even if these ports are open by port forwarding).

Port forwarding is configured at the router of a network.

- What is the name of the device that is used to configure port forwarding?
```
router
```

### Task 2  Firewalls 101
A firewall is a device within a network responsible for determining what traffic is allowed to enter and exit. Think of a firewall as border security for a network. An administrator can configure a firewall to permit or deny traffic from entering or exiting a network based on numerous factors such as:



Where the traffic is coming from? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic from a specific network?)
Where is the traffic going to? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic destined for a specific network?)
What port is the traffic for? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic destined for port 80 only?)
What protocol is the traffic using? (has the firewall been told to accept/deny traffic that is UDP, TCP or both?)
Firewalls perform packet inspection to determine the answers to these questions.





Firewalls come in all shapes and sizes. From dedicated pieces of hardware (often found in large networks like businesses) that can handle a magnitude of data to residential routers (like at your home!) or software such as Snort, firewalls can be categorised into 2 to 5 categories.




We'll cover the two primary categories of firewalls in the table below:

#### Table

|Firewall Category|Description|
|-----------------|-----------|
|Stateful|This type of firewall uses the entire information from a connection; rather than inspecting an individual packet, this firewall determines the behaviour of a device based upon the entire connection. This firewall type consumes many resources in comparison to stateless firewalls as the decision making is dynamic. For example, a firewall could allow the first parts of a TCP handshake that would later fail. If a connection from a host is bad, it will block the entire device.|
|Stateless|This firewall type uses a static set of rules to determine whether or not individual packets are acceptable or not. For example, a device sending a bad packet will not necessarily mean that the entire device is then blocked.Whilst these firewalls use much fewer resources than alternatives, they are much dumber. For example, these firewalls are only effective as the rules that are defined within them. If a rule is not exactly matched, it is effectively useless. However, these firewalls are great when receiving large amounts of traffic from a set of hosts (such as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack)|

- What layers of the OSI model do firewalls operate at?
```
Layer 3,Layer 4
```
- 
What category of firewall inspects the entire connection?
```
stateful
```
- What category of firewall inspects individual packets?
```
stateless
```

### Task 3  Practical - Firewall
Deploy the static site attached to this task. You must correctly configure the firewall to prevent the device from overloading to receive the flag!

- What is the flag?
```
THM{FIREWALLS_RULE}
```

### VPN Basics
A Virtual Private Network (or VPN for short) is a technology that allows devices on separate networks to communicate securely by creating a dedicated path between each other over the Internet (known as a tunnel). Devices connected within this tunnel form their own private network.

For example, only devices within the same network (such as within a business) can directly communicate. However, a VPN allows two offices to be connected. Let's take the diagram below, where there are three networks:
[Virtual Private Network](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/extending-your-network/vpn1.png)

1. Network #1 (Office #1)
2. Network #2 (Office #2)
3. Network #3 (Two devices connected via a VPN)
The devices connected on Network #3 are still a part of Network #1 and Network #2 but also form together to create a private network (Network #3) that only devices that are connected via this VPN can communicate over.



Let's cover some of the other benefits offered by a VPN in the table below:

#### Table

|Benefit|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Allows networks in different geographical locations to be connected.|For example, a business with multiple offices will find VPNs beneficial, as it means that resources like servers/infrastructure can be accessed from another office.|
|Offers privacy.|VPN technology uses encryption to protect data. This means that it can only be understood between the devices it was being sent from and is destined for, meaning the data isn't vulnerable to sniffing. This encryption is useful in places with public WiFi, where no encryption provided by the network. You can use a VPN to protect your traffic from being viewed by other people.|
|Offers anonyminity.|Journalists and activists depend upon VPNs to safely report on global issues in countries where freedom of speech is controlled. Usually, your traffic can be viewed by your ISP and other intermediaries and therefore tracked. The level of anonymity a VPN provides is only as much as how other devices on the network respect privacy.. For example, a VPN that logs all of your data/history is essentially the same as not using a VPN in this regard.|

TryHackMe uses a VPN to connect you to our vulnerable machines without making them directly accessible on the Internet! This means that:

- You can securely interact with our machines
- Service providers such as ISPs don't think you are attacking another machine on the Internet (which could be against the terms of service)
- The VPN provides security to TryHackMe as vulnerable machines are not accessible using the Internet.

VPN technology has improved over the years. Let's explore some existing VPN technologies below:

#### Table

|VPN Technology|Description|
|PPP|This technology is used by PPTP (explained below) to allow for authentication and provide encryption of data. VPNs work by using a private key and public certificate (similar to SSH). A private key & certificate must match for you to connect. This technology is not capable of leaving a network by itself (non-routable).|
|PPTP|The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is the technology that allows the data from PPP to travel and leave a network. PPTP is very easy to set up and is supported by most devices. It is, however, weakly encrypted in comparison to alternatives.|
|IPSec|Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) encrypts data using the existing Internet Protocol (IP) framework. IPSec is difficult to set up in comparison to alternatives; however, if successful, it boasts strong encryption and is also supported on many devices.|

- What VPN technology only encrypts & provides the authentication of data?
```
PPP
```
- What VPN technology uses the IP framework?
```
IPSec
```

### Task 5  LAN Networking Devices
What is a Router?
It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them. It does this by using routing (hence the name router!).

Routing is the label given to the process of data travelling across networks. Routing involves creating a path between networks so that this data can be successfully delivered. Routers operate at Layer 3 of the OSI model. They often feature an interactive interface (such as a website or a console) that allows an administrator to configure various rules such as port forwarding or firewalling.

Routing is useful when devices are connected by many paths, such as in the example diagram below, where the most optimal path is taken:
[Routing](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/intro-to-networking/what-is-the-internet/routing2.png)

Routers are dedicated devices and do not perform the same functions as switches.

We can see that Computer A's network is connected to the network of Computer B by two routers in the middle. The question is: what path will be taken? Different protocols will decide what path should be taken, but factors include:

- What path is the shortest?

- What path is the most reliable?

- Which path has the faster medium (e.g. copper or fibre)?


What is a Switch?

A switch is a dedicated networking device responsible for providing a means of connecting to multiple devices. Switches can facilitate many devices (from 3 to 63) using Ethernet cables.

Switches can operate at both layer 2 and layer 3 of the OSI model. However, these are exclusive in the sense that Layer 2 switches cannot operate at layer 3.

Take, for example, a layer 2 switch in the diagram below. These switches will forward frames (remember these are no longer packets as the IP protocol has been stripped) onto the connected devices using their MAC address.
[Switch](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/extending-your-network/layer2switch.png)

These switches are solely responsible for sending frames to the correct device.

Now, let's move onto layer 3 switches. These switches are more sophisticated than layer 2, as they can perform some of the responsibilities of a router. Namely, these switches will send frames to devices (as layer 2 does) and route packets to other devices using the IP protocol. 



Let's take a look at the diagram below of a layer 3 switch in action. We can see that there are two IP addresses: 

- 192.168.1.1
- 192.168.2.1
A technology called VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) allows specific devices within a network to be virtually split up. This split means they can all benefit from things such as an Internet connection but are treated separately. This network separation provides security because it means that rules in place determine how specific devices communicate with each other. This segregation is illustrated in the diagram below:
[VLAN](https://assets.tryhackme.com/additional/networking-fundamentals/extending-your-network/vlans.png)

In the context of the diagram above, the "Sales Department" and "Accounting Department" will be able to access the Internet, but not able to communicate with each other (although they are connected to the same switch).

- What is the verb for the action that a router does?
```
routing
```
- What are the two different layers of switches? Separate these by a comma I.e.: LayerX,LayerY
```
Layer2,Layer3
```
